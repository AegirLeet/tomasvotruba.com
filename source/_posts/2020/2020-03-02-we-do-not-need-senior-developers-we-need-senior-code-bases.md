    "We're looking for a Senior PHP Developer."

     "Are you a senior or a junior?"

     "How many senior developers your company has?"
    <br>
    <br>
    These and similar questions come to appear when you look for a job. The IT market says it needs more senior developers. 
    <br><br>
    I think there is more than enough. What we need are **senior code bases**.

Let's say we have 2 companies. 

<br>

**Company A** has:

- 3 years old project
- 3 junior developers
- 1 senior developer

<br> 

**Company B** has:

- 1-year-old project
- 1 junior developer
- 3 senior developers

<br>

Which would you pick a better place for your next full-time work?

<br>

## Does Level and Amount Matter?

I have no idea. Fortunately, *Bruce Lee* is here to help us:

The number of developers is not *that* relevant, neither number of developers by their skill.

It's **better to have 2 developers instead of 1**, so that they give each other feedback and grow more robust code. It's not such a big deal if it's 3+.

<br>

## Reality of Hiring Process

The *junior/senior* game is an essential part of the manipulative process during hiring in companies around me. I'll describe a model hiring situation, that was shared by my friends who looked for a job, and from my personal experience.

John is looking for a job. He founds company A and company B. **After 5 years in the same environment, where he became an expert, he's looking for somebody to learn from** - a skilled senior developer that will share his or her experience.

Saying that's he's more attracted company B, that has 3 senior developers, compared to a company with just 1. For him, it's a clear choice and signs a full-time contract with a 3 months trial period.

<br>

Now let's pause. **What misconceptions have you spotted?** Here are 3:

- senior developer === senior teacher
- senior developer === experienced developer
- 3 seniors developers have more experience than 1 senior developer
- you can learn only from people

There all 3 are `false`.

<br>

The story continues. During the first week, John only learns how to run the application and work with it. It takes some time, but he thinks it's healthy because it's a huge project.

The second week he realized the senior developers don't have time for him to teach and share their experience because they're busy fixing bugs that happen in the codebase. All 3 of them 3.

Third week he thinks about the meaning of *senior* word in this company. It's not soo much about experience or teaching, but rather **about being in the company for many years and understanding the code base** better than anybody else.

It's not about teaching, experience, nor programming skill. John's expectations have not been met. **John is disappointed**. Do you blame him?

<br>

The company also had expectations. John told them he's a senior developer. But his work during the 1st and 2nd week was very slow. Company owners felt like John was lying to them, just to get more money. Their expectations have not been met. **They're disappointed** too... do you blame them?

## We Forget What's the Most Important

We talked about junior, senior developers, teaching, experience, expectations, humans... 
Everything was so lovely and shiny at the start. We had a great team of great developers that were joined by another great developer.

**Where it went wrong? What have we missed?**

## Maturity of The Code Base  

People can make you feel better, and coffee might be good, the office might be on the highest floor with a beautiful and sunny view, money can be the highest you've ever seen. **But how well is that related to your everyday work?* 

You're not going to enjoy a coffee while watching over your city from the glass-floor view all day, you're going to work with the codebase.

That's why before I say I'll cooperate with any company, **I need to see the code base first**.

<br>

Instead of asking 3 questions in the top of this post, we should focus on:

- "How matured is your codebase?"
- "From *junior* = spaghetti code with no rules to *senior* = DI, finalized classes with CI that checks everything there can be checked and [handles code-review](/blog/2019/11/18/how-to-delegate-code-reviews-to-ci/), the newest PHP and version of your favorite framework... where does the code base stand?"
- "How do I fit into that level with my level of expertise?"

<br>

## ITinder Miss Match

The most companies I met **have junior code base, but they look for senior developers**. That's wrong and will lead mostly to John's story unhappy ending.

**Junior developers can work with junior code base** because they're not being slowed down by code base that is lower than their skill. 

Often, senior developers are hired to orientate in a terrible code base, they can't apply their experience with clean code, and they can't build a robust application with their high standards. They have to dig through the legacy code and try to fix leaking pipes.

## Senior Codebase is the Best Teacher

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    Monkey see, monkey doo.
</blockquote>

That's how our brain works; we're just like monkeys. We go to a new project, and we instinctively copy patterns we see. If there is [broken window all over the code](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/), we make more broken windows.

Some people join your team, some people stay for a long time enough to be called *seniors*, and some will leave. **The codebase remains** as long as your company exists. That's why it deserves the best treatment. 

People learn from your codebase, it's their best teacher.

<br>

Let's say you have 2 teachers in your life.

**Teacher A**:

- is teaching children for 5 years
- is in one school
- went to university 
- wears a suit
- makes a great coffee

<br>

**Teacher B**:

- don't have any school
- wears a jumper and dirty trousers
- has 80 % test coverage
- never sleeps, because CI works for him/her
- tries to be better every day
- exercises and healthy food, so his/her insides look good  
- you learn just by looking at him/her


<br>

**What teacher would you pick?**

Happy coding!
