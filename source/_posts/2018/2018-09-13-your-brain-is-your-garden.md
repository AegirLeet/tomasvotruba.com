title: "Your Brain si Your Garden"
perex: |
    After few technical and open-source posts, it's time for brain hacking. Thanks to recent boom of AI, neuroscience starts to overlap to human psychology. When it comes to learning methods, humans and computers are more alike than ever before.

    To overcome [Life 3.0](@todo book post link) disruption, you be valuable by making AI or by hacking your brain to be super-adaptable and irreplaceable.

I'm a father of 3,5 year-old that is in Czech educational system for last 1 year on one hand, a close observer of programming, machine-learning, artificial intelligence on other hand and mentor, [Europe PHP-meetup traveller](@todo link) that observes and helps people learning on the third hand.

In all these communities I see one common pattern - they all try to learn, adapt and teach as effectively as they can. They each have own believes that holds them back - I wonder how awesome jump in human history would be a conference, where human-teachers learn from programmers about the most effective way to teach a machine various skills, and where programmers would learn form teachers about effect of long-term reinforced learning. Both groups could learn so much from each others mistakes, instead of repeating them.

But let's get back to you, my dear reader, and your [attention capital](http://calnewport.com/blog/2017/11/30/on-the-complicated-economics-of-attention-capital). Recently I've been re-reading [Deep Work](@todo link) to transform my society-enforced shallow-habits to deep ones and I realized more and more that's all about attitude of every single person. Yours attitude.

## Treat Your Eyes like a Door to Your Garden

Imagine that your brain is your garden, with flowers and tree of your choice. Every flower is a skill you know, every leaf of grass is memory you bear. It's up to you, what flowers you take care about and what goes to compost. Only you can choose everyday, who you let inside by your garden door.
Only you can choose if you let in 150 incoherent tweets of 10 page from a book, if you let in 150 flowers that will die soon or let a part of tree you'll continue to grow the next day. **It's your attention span, that let's these in, you decide what you focus on.**

## Big Trees Needs Times and Care to Grow

Imagine there are 150 flowers in your garden, they need water, they need to be protected parazites and fertilized to grow strong. Where do you take time for that? You can give them all your day and energy and still some would die each week.

On the other hand, you can have 5 trees. Since trees are more fragile in the very beggining and much harder to grow, they need more of your attention in the very start. But as years goes by, they become strong and standalone. You can climb on them, they have own seeds so they grow other trees for you and you can lean on them.

In reality, most people would take flowers, because they're easier to take care of now. It's natural, since we're raised for that in school, by our society and economy system and by our parent who were raised the same.

<blockquote>
“Dream as if you will live forever; Live as if you will die today.”
― James Dean
</blockquote>

But it doesn't work very well for a long term. You might learn a lot on shallow level, but you'd not understand much in depth. One example for all, I went to school for 9 + 4 + [4 years](@todo link university advices) and I learned about somewhat 40 subjects. I would not dare to ask for job in any of that. Luckily, my parent taught me to *learn what you want* so I have 5 trees that hold my back now.

### Children and Adult are Alike, Even Smarters

You probably think now, that children have to learn basics to be able to build their know-how on them. I agree. When I learn something completely new with 0 know-ledge - like how parser works -, I know I have to learn basics first. I give it 30 minutes a day, because I know trees take time to grow. If I'd give it 6 hours a day, like in a school, I know I would fail, feel bad that I'm slow and probably never learn it.

From my personal single-ase observation and 3 years on Psychology Univesiry Children I see that brain of children works very similar way as adult one, it's still a neural networks. Even better, because they're at very beginning, *tabula rasa*, where they can land basics for their gardens.

Instead, some else is going to visit their garden and decide what's good for them and what flowers and trees they should grow. With no clear evidence why and mostly, without understanding the garden's owner. And understanding is the msot important in learning, right?

And here is the place where artificial inteligence era can bring a lot to human education and vice versa. Machines are never treated that way, because that is not efficient, and we found out that by [expeirmenting](@todo link to expeirment), failing and learning form mistakes. Doing similar research on human is restricted by human rights, so we're motivated to repeat same mistakes over and over again on each generation of human.

## Experiment and Learn About Yourself

Instead of going for average and "what works for the most must work for me", go for youself. https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats

Your garden is the most important one and as one my very smart friend told me:
"Each of has our own universte and none one-is never ever get to understand it."

Take a break for a day or two, think about what you let in your garden word and what trees will hold your back, if you'll ever need them. Your life is about your, your dreams, your universe and your garden. Take care of it well, you children will thank you.

"Don't waste your time by working on dreams of someone else."
