# Why should you care for Future Sustanbility?

- some developer code for now, this project, single site for 2018 ellections, microsite for new product releaste in 2019; all that has hype is allowed
	- just throw everythign to one bag or maybe right in the city streets or nature - sb will handel that, yolo!
- some developer code for next 1-2 years, they use test, continuous integration, use stable packasge with 1.0 release 
	- you have pt all trash to trash bins, take them out reguallary every week

(image of bags)
- and few develops code for future sustainbility - design patterns, immortcal code patterns - you code once and the will last ~5 years, and the know this from experience, because they work on 5th open-source project they need to last as long as possible without as little maintenance as possible 
    
    - it's like recycling platic bags and papers - you put effrot and space to keep separated trash bins in your home, split every product to own bin and take when full, take these bags out 5 minutes walk 
	- though you never see that trash again, you believe it's good for your future self and for your children, to keep planet clean and without war over gradually rare material


This is for people who have children and/or want the best for them, or at least for your younger friends.





## what happens when application grows?


Let's imagine a middle ages project - 4yeras:
2014-2018

(also add code)

- yera 0 - oh put this in controller, it's fast, in documnetaion and easy to extends to anotehr - it's just list of products
- in 1 year from proet start, you start using commands, and want to recount prices there
- in 2 yeras, mobile and REST API comes, so you need to creat special Rest controlelrs providign list of products
- in 3 years, you're slowly thinking about AI and product recommentation and you're using EventSubscribers - saving information about user in Redis and using machine learning with eveolution algorithm suggesting best products right away - it's just 


## where you en up?


## where do you want to end-up

...this decopuled

## Does business give you millions of money for refacgoring playign? Nope!


...do it right from the first step

Do you separate your trash after you see plastic and paper products are being more and more expensive and there are dumps all over you country?


No. You think for the future **prevention**

<live as for today, platn for the fuure> quote...



Same can be applied to your code!



This is what we did in Lekanara.cz, czech biggest drug seller running on Nette 2.4, Doctrine 2.5, with monorepo approach (link that post with local split packages) and bunch of other tools.



When you start with the best known approach possible, you'll probably endup in well grown project that you'll love to contribute the older it gets. Just like children :)


Happy Growing!
