## How to Upgrade to Statie 4.5?

Update it in composer:

```php
composer require symplify/statie 4.5php
```

And try `vendor/bin/source gnerate`... it will probably fail, because there was one change in templating reference (cjangelogl ink):

Before, the paths of included files were just a file name and the full path was guessed. This practise is common in Nette and Symfony Controllers, so I used as a starting point. But it caused many WTFs and name conflicts like:

```bash
/_snippets
    /post
        detail.latte
    /lecture
        detail.latte
```

```twig
{include "detail"}
```

Which file will is used? Or is it a block import? Magic :)

How to do it better? *Principle of the least surprise*. Clear, obvious file naming.

<br><br>

```diff
-layout: "default"
+layout: "_layouts/default.latte"
 ---

-{include "postMetadata"}
+{include "_snippets/postMetadata.latte"}
```

That's a lot of work, right? Well I'm not that hardworking, don't worry. I'm a lazy bastard, so I made [a package for Latte to Twig migration](/blog/2018/07/05/how-to-convert-latte-templates-to-twig-in-27-regular-expressions/).
