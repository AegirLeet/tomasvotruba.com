title: "Don't Read Books"
perex: |
    You're probably thinking: "He's joking, right? That's kind of that title, that is a parody to show us we should do the opposite. You won't get us again, Tomas."
    <br>
    <br>
    **No, I really don't think we should read books nor feel bad for not reading them**. And now talk about those non-fiction books with the knowledge that readers want to use in their lives.

    Do you still think this is sarcasm? Keep on reading.

I've read [256 Bloghacks](/blog/2018/04/12/the-best-5-of-256-bloghacks-book/), [Steal Like an Artist, Deep Work, No More Mr. Nice Guy](/blog/2017/09/25/3-non-it-books-that-help-you-to-become-better-programmer/), [Selling is Human](/blog/2018/06/18/14-surprising-tip-from-selling-is-human-to-influence-others/) and [Life 3.0](/blog/2017/12/04/life30-what-will-you-do-when-ai-takes-over-the-world/) during last 2 years and a couple more I haven't written about yet.

I mostly love books.

I just don't think it's the best-written format to learn from and that such format can actually hurt learning. It's not the author, the topic, but really the format to blame.

## Single Person Monolog

When you read a book, you absorb information without much critical thinking. There is no space to express disagreement, to pose a question, to clarify, to add a tip of your own. So we get used to just read, be silent and absorb. Can you recall any other situation in your life, where you absorb information without a doubt? I can't.

And be sure to let me know [in the comments](#comments) if you [disagree](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html).

## Best-Seller vs. Best-Read

I'm known to be a minimalist so my bookshelf bears only 5 books, while all my other friends have 20-30 books. I always wondered "do they read so fast, wow they're smart"? So I was curious:

- "Which are your favorite books?"
- "What do you read now?"
- "Well, how many have you read actually?"

The answers vary a bit, but the last question usually hits the nail on the head. It's barely a 1/4 on average.

### Buy a Book to Have Friends

Then I realized that "bestseller" has nothing to do with the content. It's like having a cool free application in your phone that you never use or famous "friend" on Facebook you never write but anyone can see you're "friends".

Hype beats knowledge, at least at the time being. **It's less important how book really is valuable to the reader than how cool it is, how nice cover it has, how many of my friends and celebrities recommend it**.

I personally know many technical books from Czech authors that people bought, but never read. Which makes me sad for both sides, the reader and the author, and also for the trees that will now lie dead on shelf made from another tree.

## The Longer, The Vaguer

Imagine this post would have 20 pages. I would go on detail, start to talk about my day and how everyday life is connected to reading books and what I read in my childhood and formed me to who I am... blah blah blah.

It's called state of *flow* and you can see it very clearly when somebody give a talk that lasts 30+ minutes. It's not a rule, but the easiest way to spot it in the public.

Why? Because [flow makes people happy](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow) and they [thoroughly focus on the present, hours seem to pass by the minute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    "Give me a man a week to finish a 4-hour work &ndash; he'll finish it in a week.
    <br>
    Give him 4 hours to finish a week work &ndash; he'll finish it in 4 hours."
</blockquote>

One example for all: have you ever read my bachelor thesis about polyphasic sleep that has 50+ pages? Me neither, so I made [a short post](/blog/2018/02/12/sleep-shorter-to-get-62-percent-smarter/).

## The Book Chapter Format vs. Skill Leveling

Book format is great for stories. There is a beginning, plot... well, the classic *Hero's Journey*.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Heroesjourney.svg/398px-Heroesjourney.svg.png" class="img-thumbnail">

It works for stories, but what about skills and know-how? Let's say you have a new job and you want to learn a new framework - Symfony.
Do you buy "a Symfony book" and read it? And then you know Symfony? You might and you'll might be feeling great about it.

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    "It's interesting how brain works when you have no clue."
    <todo vienna meetup>
</blockquote>

But what do so much of random education (it has its meaning, but not here) if your first task is to create a contact form? Maybe there are [posts about writing forms that go beyond the documentation](https://github.com/pehapkari/awesome-symfony-education#forms) that take you 20 minutes to read.

Having a whole book would probably confuse you and make you feel great at the same time.


## Everlasting Deprecation

Like [menstruation](/blog/2017/10/30/what-can-you-learn-from-menstruation-and-symfony-releases/), the cycle of life is very similar to circle of knowledge - or to paradigm if you prefer.

<img src="https://images.clipartuse.com/a455c631591f21d0dfdad4372b4dabba_tree-fall-spring-s8ummer-winter-clip-art-at-clkercom-vector-clip-_1053-218.svg" class="img-thumbnail">

Imagine your last PHP application you work on. You started fresh and with PHP 7.2, with the newest version of Symfony 4.1 and all goes great. Do you that in 3 years you'll be using PHP 8.0 and Symfony 5.0 or rather stick to the old ones?

I'd pick first, because the trend is they're faster, easier to learn and more intuitive to use.

Using old one (for whatever business reasons) is called *vendor lock* or *legacy code*.

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2018/no-books/legacy.png" class="img-thumbnail">

Same vendor lock happens to knowledge. You can see it most of school systems, where 40 years old people teach 15 years their "up-to-date" know-how. People write PHP 7 as PHP 5.3, because there are so many old books out there.

### Wikipedia 2010 in 2018?

**Imagine that Wikipedia would be published just once 10 years as a book**. So today, in 2018, somebody would quote a 8-year-old information in his school essay. It's crazy, right? But that's how books work naturally.

<br><br>

Yet, is there a better way to share inter-connected deep knowledge than in books that would be longer a single standalone post?

There is no silver bullet, but I have few proposals that *knowledge writers* (= anyone sharing knowledge in test) can do to make content better and readers smarter in the long-term. It would not earn as much money as "best" selling books, so if you need money, sorry, I have no better suggestion.


@todo next post?


## Between a Blog Post and a Book

<br><br>

### Tested Content is Super Easy To Keep Up-To-Date

Is there a code in your post or chapter, piece of text? It <a href="https://pehapkari.cz/blog/2017/01/12/why-articles-with-code-examples-should-be-CI-tested/">should be tested</a>. Back to our Symfony book. Imagine you buy it, you read it and there is section about forms. But thanks to *everlasting deprecation* effect, you happen to use Symfony 4.1, but book is about Symfony 3.0, so it doesn't work and you've just wasted 20 $ in money for a book and hundreds $ in time investment.

Now imagine this post would be tested, with unit tests and Travis CI that would run daily to make sure the content is still valuable in the present. The day new Symfony with BC break is released, the new version of post is published. And that works super easily for version 4, version 5, version 6...

Btw, I know you can find up-to-date know-how for Symfony Forms in the documentation, but this is just an example. It could be any more complex non-documented code, like writing a [Console application with Dependency Injection](/blog/2018/05/28/build-your-first-symfony-console-application-with-dependency-injection-under-4-files/).


### Let People In To Your Hearth

...or at least your thoughts. **A book content is one-man-show, with one-man ideas** and I think that is dangerous, unless we talk about God that helps us all and everyone can agree on that.

<blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
    I believe the community of people knows much more than the most skilled person in it
</blockquote>

If people cooperate and talk to each other, they can bring much more value and higher quality solutions.
That's probably the reason companies have more than 1 employee, right? :)

How to allow this in written content? Simple, allow comments. Allow them all the time, [without censorship of opposed ideas](/blog/2018/01/29/how-to-deal-with-haters-in-comments-and-github/).

That way people can express themselves and improve content to be:

- community-proofed
- validated by more than 1 person
- questioned if that is really the best there is (at the time of reading)

### Let People build the Content

If you allow comments, it's the first step to improve the content. But most people read the content and not the comments - by naturally, you need to read the post, so you could understand comments under it.

What if the readers could change the content? And what if you make it as easy for them as [clinking a link](https://github.com/TomasVotruba/tomasvotruba.cz/edit/master/source/_posts/2018/2018-01-29-how-to-deal-with-haters-in-comments-and-github.md). (@todo this post)

@todo commit examle

That way the content is cooperative work of more people, more authors would be happy to share it and get credit for it. 3 posts about Symfony Console [proven practice](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/proven-practices-process-stan-garfield) by 3 different authors can never be as good as 1 written by 3 authors together.

### Levelling Up Tailored to Your Personal Needs

Each of us has different experience, past, motivation and know-how. It makes no sense that all of us read whole book about Symfony.

Also each skill has a group - *a cluster* of knowledge of various levels that you can master.

<img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*T_ayhu6CBO2O23nXgHyMhw.png">

It makes no sense that everyone would read the same book from beginning till the end. Instead you can start at level 5, I can start
at level 2, and somebody only wants the level 10, if there is something new he can learn in the field he thinks he masters already.

With a cluster of posts, you can see clearly where to start and what you want to read.

### The Next Nearest Skill

This is connected to *prerequisite skill* system. Each skill is followed by the nearest one that is super easy to learn thanks to previous experience.

Imagine a learning curve when you drive a bike, then motorcycle, then a car and than a bus.

vs.

You drive a bike and then you jump directly to the bus.

Which can build on previous experience and utilize neuron patterns faster?

### Inform Clearly about Deprecations and Changes

The last but most least, people often return to content they believe in and look for iterative improvement in it. That's why we use StackOverflow and see answers that worked in 2015 to have 100 vote, but also there is a new one in 2018, that has already 20 votes and in 2020 there will come even better one...

That's why I try to make clear what and how changed right in the beginning on such posts:

@todo screen of updated/deprecated post

You might see this as redundant work and that I'm a nerd (guilty!), but I'm super-focused on you, my readers and I want you to understand every change that happens so you can learn fast and safe.
