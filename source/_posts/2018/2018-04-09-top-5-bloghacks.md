Vojta was so kind to lend me the book over the lunch. This post is about my first question I asked Vojta: what "what are the top 5 tips he has taken from this book?"

I mean, 256 is a lot. But most of them are common, some are better and only a few are gold. I look for the gold in books. Here is what I found   

You know yegor from

- code [awards](http://www.yegor256.com/award.html): https://github.com/php-ai/php-ml#awards - friend of mine 
- go sub [here](http://www.yegor256.com/award.html) - it's worth if nothing just the feedback




## TOP 5

## 1. blog once a week for  2 years
    - I've added Thurdsay and it's super addictive
    - it takes time to mature priority - i recall how i tried similar thing a year ago and it was super fail, I got bailed for a month myself
    - I just dump my ideas to issues, then go there while travelling on my mobile and pick the most interesteing topic so far

## 2. reddit, be active - how it works and unwritten rules
    - Vojta Shared with me his experience-based meeting with configuration
        - autoban - when you post 2 or more self-referene right away
    - this applied to every community, if you go Twitter, be active there
        - I use twitter as automated RSS (@todo here, thanks Peter Vacha) and move mostly on Github/Reddit 

## 3. Static website
    - fast, easy, open-source, if anyone will come, they can fix a bug or update old text and you only merge the PR
    - if you don't

## 4. search on website - Agolia/Google
    - i relaize this blog has many words and it's hard to find, .e.g hwne you go "symfony controller" just using Ctrl + F, you'll miss
    - Google fixes that
    - just yestaerday I 've added Google (@pr link), aloglaie works on statie page, so I requrested a similar Docintergraiton (link), but in the 
## 5. stackoverflow answers => post
    - I took the tip to practice here and here

## And mine extra top 3 tips?

### 1. Write in Englihs even if non-native

why? it's easier non-natives to non-natives. Both share more common vocabulary (@todo kxkd), https://xkcd.com/simplewriter/, same applies to coding with my favorite oocams razor, btw)

### 2. Write  pain points you meet often 

For me it'"s clearly static, services locators vs. constructor injection.

### 3. Write about your "vzory" people around you that helped you to get hwre you are

Everyone is writing about "how to do htis in the coe", "new in X.y".

But thanks to all the coding and programming we almost forgot about the most important thing in the wordls: relations ships.

@todo my quote help people ziglar
