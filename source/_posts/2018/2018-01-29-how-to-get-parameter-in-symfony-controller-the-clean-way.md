title: "How to Deal With Haters in Comments and Github"
perex: '''
        That's what I was asked yesterday for about fifth person already. How do I deal with that when I write an article tweet, just doing good things godly enlightenment, and someone does not like it and throwing dirt on me?

I learned this process while being a maintainer of [ApiGen](/blog/2017/09/04/how-apigen-survived-its-own-death/) for 1 year and then 6 months  again, where I got to dozens of online-hate-wars and found that it leads nowhere. Then I tried another way. **Compassion.**

Today I will summarize it in 3 points:


## 1. Process Emotion

Yes, it hurts. When I write a tutorial on how to deal with hater, and someone writes me: *IT'S STUPID* - it hurts. I put so much work in it and instead of a like I get slapped. **In fact, that could be a feedback. With a little effort even constructive.**

What information he or she wants to communicate to me? In 90% of cases:

- "I do not understand that."
- "I understood it differently than you meant."
- "I see it differently."

**I do not respond right away**. When I feel uncomfortable, I'd only return the same emotion and the same would get back.

I take an hour break if you need.


## 2. I'm Interested

I want to know what's on the other's mind. I try to find something useful for me, to make my work better next time.

### How do I respond?

- "It's a total crap '=> What you disagree?
- "That never works" => How do you think it could work?
- "You're doing it wrong" => Why do you think so?

The reaction always depends on the context of the situation.

In most cases **the reaction to such question is more constructive than the first comment**. And that's enough for me. **I'll take more from it than if I'd remain silent and returned back emotion**.

## 3. I'll Consider if it's Worth it and if so, Iterate

Baby steps. I do not expect that I get positive / pro-growth / [sandwich](@todo) feedback to my first answer - after all, it took me year to get from *that's wrong* to useful and well-accepted feedback.

Sometimes it takes time, sometimes I regress and mirror anger back, but I try to remember the first point - process emotion. When it doesn't work, I just stop and focus somewhere else.

Often we get from potential argument to his or her new pull-request. And sometimes we stay at *the wrong* :)

**Are you interested on how to reduce the hate-risk already when writing the article, issue or pull-request description?**

### Pro tip

24-hour chill on Github

@todo did you know github offeres you 24 perios chill time for your organization?
It's super feature, that can give everyone time to process and relaize what happens. Outsize the emotional tornado. With calm and peaceful mind.
 
 @todo scree

I wish I knew this before.

Don't worry, be happy!
