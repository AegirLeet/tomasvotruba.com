Rector vision aka open-source behind scenes

----


thank you for your reply. It gave me a very nice kick and more energy to my blood to work on this.


Sorry for my late reply, but I had to explore my vision with Rector a lot. I had to face many blinds paths and demons.

I held talks in Berlin (Symfony meetup :)), Vienna and Prague during past 3 months and had to think a lot about the following direction. I talked with author of PHPActor (~Rector just as plugin for Vim), and from Nils Adermann with insights from private packagist. I got plenty of feedback, offline and online.

Many people told me to go for "Symfony"shift. It would make money, it would save bug reports from people, since I'd be the one to manage it and I could invest that money to grow Rector a more.

But then I got feedback from more communities. I'm in touch with CakePHP community. In last week I made this config that can do 140 changes in Cake PHP 3.4:
https://github.com/rectorphp/rector/pull/634/files#diff-66bde3273ac825a92cf71b2e0bb9f674 
Everyone is having the same problem: they need to move fast wide-spread legacy code in their growing communities.

Also, a company from Vienna invited me again, sponsored my travel + stay and we made live PR to php-parser in a matter of 30 seconds: https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/pull/533 It got merged 2 days after. The company itself is almost finished with a migration of private legacy code to Laravel and they were interested in Rector's features.

Have you seen "safe" package in Github trends? Rector is now helping people to migrate their code: https://github.com/thecodingmachine/safe#automated-refactoring


Yes, I could go to one community and help only them to make the migration almost flawless. But now I see many communities using Rector creative way I could never think of. Also, I'm not doing this for money (like ClangMR from Google or Larashift), but so programmers can be free with the most recent version of the framework they love. So, for now, I'm deciding to stay open, help here and there little with projects that come along, and see what inspiration it brings to people. 



Now back to you - I'd be very happy for any help from your side. Either promo on socials, sponsorship on talk on Symfony conference, in exchange for cooperation on a project where Rector might help you and Symfony, and also as a case study for both projects.


Let me know what works for you. I'love Symfony and it's community and would love to help you and Rector to grow in mutual cooperation.
