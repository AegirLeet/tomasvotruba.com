Today the format will be reversed - first I'll show you practical code and it's journey to legacy, then theory takeaways that would save it.

[Symplify\CodingStandard](https://github.com/symplify/codingstandard) contains complex Sniff and Fixers like [the doc block cleaner](/blog/2017/12/17/new-in-symplify-3-doc-block-cleaner-fixer/). Job of `RemoveUselessDocBlockFixer` is clear - **remove any doc block that has no extra value over the php code itself**:

```diff
 /**
- * @param int $value value instance
- * @param $anotherValue
- * @param SomeType $someService A SomeType instance
- * @return array 
  */
 public function setCount(int $value, $anotherValue, SomeType $someService): array
 {
 }
```

The goal is clear, but **how does it work beneath the surface**? There are multiple steps that Fixer needs to perform one by one: 

- find a method
- find its docblock
- find parameters in method code, detect their names and types 
- compare them to docblock
- judge value of description (e.g. "a Type instance" has no value)
- remove those that were find useless

Is that all? Nope. **There also code that handles php docs**:

- doc block parser that can parse any doc comment 
- that can handle invalid and non-standard formats
- and a doc block printer, that can keep original spacing

Just a reminder, this all started from a simple idea:

```diff
-/**
- * @param int $value
- */
 public function compute(int $value)
 {
 }
```

Today I'll write about **how code always grows and that we should anticipate it and code the best way we know right from the beginning**. And what happened to me when I thought I could handle it by *using static methods only where it makes sense* (well, everything makes sense, untill it's legacy drowning you down).

## Story Of Static Growth

Let's look how the fixer grow to the point it turned into legacy, show myself and what could (and will) do better to prevent it.  

(To skip irrelevant details, I'll use pseudo code instead of [original full code](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/blob/5603ed130bfd29bfdad050b7726b9c8e65a558fd/packages/CodingStandard/src/Fixer/Commenting/RemoveUselessDocBlockFixer.php).)

```php
class RemoveUselessDocBlockFixer
{
    public function fix($tokens)
    {
        foreach ($tokens as $token) {
            if (! $token->isMethod()) {
                continue;
            }
            
            // it's method!
            $docBlock = $this->getDocBlockByMethod($token);
            if ($docBlock === null) {
                continue;
            }
            
            // it has a doc block!
            $this->removeUselessContentFromDocBlock($docBlock);
        }
    }
}
```

That basic work flow. In Easy Coding Standard 3 and bellow, checkers have no constructor injection, only `new` and `::static` methods were allowed. I took this inspiration from [PHP CS Fixer where `new` is first class citizen](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=new+TokensAnalyzer&type=). Where is no DI container, just static instantiations. Maybe that should warn me, but I said to myself "its popular package, it have new fixers from time to time and it's tagged once a while, it's must be good and they know what they're doing".

So back to the code:

```php
public static function getDocBlockByMethod($token)
{
    $docBlockPosition = DocBlockFinder::find($token);
    if ($docBlockPosition === null) {
        return null;
    }
    
    return DocBlockFactory::createFromPosition($docBlockPosition);
}
```

```php
public static funciton removeUselessContentFromDocBlock($docBlock)
{
    DocBlockCleaner::processParamAnnotations($docBlock);
    DocBlockCleaner::processReturnAnnotations($docBlock);
}
```

### Static with 3rd Party Code?

You see where it goes. The biggest potential black hole is always 3rd party code (unless it's your code). I could write docblock parser myself or make use of [phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock). It the best on the market in that time. Not ready for PHP 5.5+ features like variadics nor formatter preserving printer. Apart that it worked quite good.

```php
class DocBlockFactory
{
    public static function createFromPosition($docBlockPosition)
    {
        $tagFactory = new StandardTagFactory($fqsenResolver, [
            'param' => TolerantParam::class, // own overloaded class
            'return' => TolerantReturn::class, // own overloaded class
            'var' => Var_::class, // own overloaded class
        ]);
        
        $descriptionFactory = new DescriptionFactory($tagFactory);
        $tagFactory->addService($descriptionFactory);
        $tagFactory->addService(new TypeResolver($fqsenResolver));
        
        $phpDocumentorDocBlockFactory = new DocBlockFactory($descriptionFactory, $tagFactory);
        
        return $phpDocumentorDocBlockFactory->create($docBlockPositoin);   
    }
}
```

So every time a single doc block is created, more than 10 classes (counting these on background) is created too. It might be small deal for performance, but even bigger for legacy code smell that would just me back. But whatever, YOLO!

And here all the static fun ends. Well, not yet, because it worked. I talked a lot with maintainer of `phpDocumentor/ReflectionDocBlock` about moving it forward, but as I was the only one trying, it didn't lead much further than issue chats and PRs that were opened for too long time. It was only logical that without [monorepo](https://gomonorepo.org/) all the time was swallowed only by maintenance of 4 interdependent packages.

### A New Shiny Package?

Then [Jan TvrdÃ­k](https://github.com/JanTvrdik) came with support package for PHPStan, that handles php docs - [phpstan/phpdoc-parser](https://github.com/phpstan/phpdoc-parser). It is build on similar principals as `nikic/php-parser`, much younger and robust. 

I thought: "I'd like to try that one package in my code", but how? 

It's easy, just replace all the old static classes with new-ones:

```php
class DocBlockFactory
{
    public static function createFromPosition($docBlockPosition)
    {
        $content = $this->getContentOnPosition($docBlockPosition);

        $lexer = new Lexer;
        $tokenIterator = new TokenIterator($lexer->tokenize($content));
        
        $phpStanPhpDocParser = new PhpStanPhpDocParser(new SomeDependency(new NewAnotherDependency));

        return $phpStanPhpDocParser->parse($tokenIterator);
    }
}
```

### Adding Depedency to Static Hell Tree

Do you need to add whitespace config? Just add it in every layer... or make it also static. 

```diff
 class DocBlockFactory
 {
     public static function createFromPosition($docBlockPosition)
     {
         $content = $this->getContentOnPosition($docBlockPosition);

         $lexer = new Lexer;
         $tokenIterator = new TokenIterator($lexer->tokenize($content));
        
         $phpStanPhpDocParser = new PhpStanPhpDocParser(new SomeDependency(new NewAnotherDependency));
        
-        return $phpStanPhpDocParser->parse($tokenIterator);
+        $docBlock = $phpStanPhpDocParser->parse($tokenIterator);
+        $docBlock->addWhitespaceConfig($this->whitespaceConfig);
+        
+        return $docBlock;
    }
+    
+    public funciton setWhitespaceConfig(WhitespaceConfig $WhitespaceConfig)
+    {
+        $this->whitespaceConfig = $whitespaceConfig;
+    }
}
```

But what if you forget to add it

```diff
+    public funciton ensureWhitespaceConfigIsSet()
+    {
+        if ($this->whitespaceConfig) {
+            return; 
+        }        
         
+        throw new WhitespaceConfigNotSetException(sprintf('Informative message in "%s" method', __METHOD__));
+    }
```

Congratulations, you've just made a static container all over your code, similar to Laravel Facades.
Uff, I just get headache by writing this code.

But why stopping there? Lets add a configuration, that will tell the `DocBlockFactory` if the starting tag should be `/*` or `/**`. 
Well shoot me now!


## How to Get From Static Hell?

### 1. Dependency Injection <strike>First</strike> Only

Dependency injection First. Not first, but **only** dependency injection.

I told to myself - "here the static method makes sense, its just one litle method". The problem is, that static methods work well only with other static methods. You simply can't inject service to class with static methods and use it statically.. well to be honest, Laravel did it in facades and Reflections, but you should not. Unless you want to use such approach in whole codebase. That would be the only valid reason to do it so.

**So be consistent in architecture pattern you pick.**

It took me [3](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/680) [pull](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/693) [requests](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/723) to get out of this mess. Not to try new package, just to prepare the code to be able to do so. Instead I could have clear DI design, use one PR time to trying this package and other 2 PRs could be new features.    

### 2. Beware Your Inner Copy-Cat Coder

> A copycat crime is a criminal act that is modelled or inspired by a previous crime that has been reported in the media or described in fiction.

This all started by social learning. I saw static approach in Fixers in PHP CS Fixer and I was making a Fixer. So why not use it? I felt in my guts it's not the best way to go, but I was not sure why and I didn't see anybody else using DI in CLI applications. Now I now why. 
  
If you ever have a feeling, that's there is better way to do things but you'll see that some Tomas Votruba is doing it differently, take your time - **trust yourself, your intuition guides you for a reason**. Question him and propose better idea, even though it might be crazy. Maybe you'll save yourself and him few PRs and many frustrated days from climbing up the legacy hole. 

### 3. Sniff It - Setup and Forget

<a href="https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/722" class="btn btn-dark btn-sm">
    <em class="fa fa-github fa-fw"></em>
    See pull-request #722
</a>

To prevent this 10 hours of trauma happening ever again, I made [a `ForbiddenStaticFunctionSniff` sniff](https://github.com/symplify/codingstandard#use-services-and-constructor-injection-over-static-method) that will look after your code.

<em class="fa fa-fw fa-times"></em>

```php
class SomeClass
{
    public function someFunction()
    {
    }
}
```

<em class="fa fa-fw fa-check"></em>

```php
class SomeClass
{
    public static function someFunction()
    {
    }
}
```

I've added this sniff to set before refactoring, scan the code and [added all found files to ignored](https://github.com/Symplify/Symplify/pull/722/files#diff-a8b950982764fcffe4b7b3acd261cf91R84). That way I knew what all classes need refactoring. 

### 4. Remove `Static` from Methods - One Step at a Time

I always do this in one single PR, starting with the simplest factory from ignored files above.

Remove the `static` in one factory:

```diff
 class UseImportsTransformer
 {
-    public static function addNamesToTokens(...)
+    public function addNamesToTokens(...)
 }
```

Pass it via constructor:

```diff
 class RemoveUselessDocBlockFixer
 {
+    /**
+     * @var UseImportsTransformer
+     */
+    private $userImportsTransformer;
+
+    public function __construct(UseImportsTransformer $userImportsTransformer)
+    {
+        $this->userImportsTransformer = $userImportsTransformer;
+    }     
 }
```

And use it in code:

```diff
-UseImportsTransformer::addNamesToTokens($this->newUseStatementNames, $tokens);
+$this->useImportsTransformer->addNamesToTokens($this->newUseStatementNames, $tokens);
```

### 5. Keep Your Shit Clean

I also admit, that another code smell lead to this. In Symplify and Rector there is used [Symfony 3.3 services architecture](/blog/2017/05/07/how-to-refactor-to-new-dependency-injection-features-in-symfony-3-3/) with autowiring and autodiscovery. State of art in PHP DI at the moment.

But Fixers and Checkers were exception, they were registered as services, but no autowired. So I was used to not-to add depedendecy to them manually, but via setters, `new` or `::static`. So it eventually and logically lead to this situation.    

I learned something new and [migrated to full-service approach in ECS 4](/blog/2018/03/26/new-in-easy-coding-standard-4-clean-symfony-standard-with-yaml-and-services/).


## 3 Takeaways You Should not Take Statically

- Static is not only `::method()`, but also `new <class>` and `::create()`.
- Use dependency injection, or static method methods. Be consistent everywhere in your code, or it will eventually backfire.
- There is no best way to do thing, you just have to experience limits of various approaches and use the one that performs the best. And re-evaluate. 

<br><br> 

They also say that wisdom is ability to learn from others' mistake.

I hope you learned something new today!
