@todo noise inbox with milions of messages


leo babauta
popularized this copcept of having 0 emails after you've visited the inbox - resolved, posponed (e.g. will return in 5 days) or achived

It looks like this

trick is the less noise you have, the more performance your brain can focus on single tasks.

it applies in email


## so what is Zero IM-box?

Since smartpohesn, I usually have **7 SMS on single display. 1 new, 6 already resolved**. That would be ok, if your brain is filtering the noise, but not if you're applin inbox zero method


I've tried to archive all message.

And it works like a charm. My ability to response sms rise, and blood pressure from switching visual modes decresed :)

You can

- remember what to resolve
- know who to response
- can approach all sms per der in chunks with same approach as in google inbox
- get wider attention span over time
- be more focused on single message at a time 
- and resolve messages more quickyl




But also

**WhatsApp**

**[Messenger](https://messenger.com)**

**Hangouts**

same rules applied, same profit got ;)


### Gain for Brains

Once I've read (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Universe_in_a_Nutshell) in my teenage days. I remember single quote from it: 

<blockquote class="blockquote">
    "Think in structures."
</blockquote>

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/imbox-zero/universe.jpg" class="img-thumbnail">


I didn't know what that mean, but thotu that Steve might be a smart guy, so tried to.

Btw, if you don't know much about universe, definitely read this easy-to-understand intro book.


In our use case, instead of having 2 and probably more brain algorithms to resolve incoming message, we will have only 1.

Thus having more neurons to do job we need them to do.

Like finding a good coffee anywhere you are :)


Bless neuroplasticity and happy thinking!
