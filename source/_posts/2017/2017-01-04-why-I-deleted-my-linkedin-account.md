title: "Why I deleted my LinkedIn account"
perex: '''
    I used LinkedIn since 2008 when it was sending spam to all my friends. After 8 years of tuning my profile to 95 % score, reading mostly copy-pasted messages,
    checking false notifications, flirting with HR girls and hoping for up votes for my recent skills, <strong>I've decided it is time to let it go</strong>. Why and what I'm gonna do now?

*Disclaimer: even if I get few abroad offers, my experience is related to work environment in the Czech Republic.*

I was reviewing my 2016 on social networks disconnection: I reduced 350 friends on Facebook to 20, unfollowed all but 2 groups and I dropped all people I follow on Twitter. 
My attention got better and I could focus on things that really mattered to me. That's why I started though about the next step.

And LinkedIn account was something scratching on my mind for a long time.

So I asked myself?


## What is LinkedIn good for me?

- It helped me in my first 3 years in paid PHP programming field. 
- I got some references and up-votes for my skills, I attended university so I thought it gives me credibility.
- It gave me self-confidence when talking about money.
- Everybody did it, so did I (like that time I jumped out of the window :).


## Where LinkedIn Fails for me  

### It's kinda Broken and Stuck Service

I was getting fake notifications of new connections. I got over 20 pings for 6 moths-old and answered message.
Also, I didn't notice many changes between 2008 and 2016. It could be much more further. Btw, do you remember MySpace?
 

### Irrelevant Messages - 95 % Job Offers are Spam 

I only got **2 jobs I wanted** in the whole 8 years. Most of offers are general random messages from bots or people,
who don't even read descriptions like *part-time only* or *Symfony project only*.


### Target group Bias

I never look for PHP full-time job. I wanted part-times only. Not really favorite position on LinkedIn, is it?
last 2 years I only offered consultancy and lecturing. Well, is that a full-time position? 


### More info sources = more outdated info  

I put my work information on my website, Facebook and LinkedIn. The more I have, the more outdated they are. And I'm not alone.
I often see friends who have 3 years empty space on LinkedIn and website, yet still looking for new job.


### Skill Lagging

What can you tell about me from this picture?

<img src="/assets/images/posts/2017/linked-in/skills.png" class="thumbnail" alt="Skill list">

The oldest skills are upvoted the most. Also short and traditional, like Git. Even if I excel in coaching and open-source,
it looks like I'm 3× better in Git. No, I'm not. So when I got new skill, it took LinkedIn 3 years to reflect. In that time, I'm already somewhere else.


## Dying in Comfort Zone

**This is the most important take away.**

LinkedIn was my comfort zone. It's like being woman on a Tinder. When I want sex, I have it. And I get many messages and attention from females with not much work.
This backfires.  

Having so much attention and job position anytime I want makes me lazy. I don't need to improve. With this state of mind I would not probably reach the dream job as if I would be **proactive**.

Moreover when I've got quite long profile:

- 5 great jobs
- 3 startups
- 3 talks
- 2 abroad conferences
- 25 skills
- 7 recommendations

As friend of mine Albert once said:
"Once you stop learning you start dying."


This is the greatest change I take from deleting this account. 

Now I want to build something real.
  

## Is it Your Time to Let Go?

If you:
 
- are on the start of your career,
- don't have own website,
- don't have 3+ references,
- look for full-time job
- and don't want to work for yourself but rather for company,

I would recommend keeping that profile. 

But when you answered *NO* to all of these, here what you could do:

## Be Proactive &ndash; Find Yourself better Job

- Build personal brand on good old relationships.
- Talk with people.
- Find active social networks where you interact with you peers - for me it is Facebook or our PHP Comminity [Péhápkaři Slack](http://pehapkari.slack.com).
- Go to meetup.

But this is my story, my personal needs and my personal experience. It probably [won't work for everybody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence). Your experience might be different. 

So, what about you?
