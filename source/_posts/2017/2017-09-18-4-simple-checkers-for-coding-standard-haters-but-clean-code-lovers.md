    Do you find coding standards too <strong>annoying in telling you where to put that bracket</strong>?
    Is that the reason you haven't tried them yet?

There are some checkers in coding standard world, that don't check spaces, tabs, commas nor brackets. They **actually do code-review for you**.


I use a set of 4 checkers to **check open-source packages to help them keeping their code clean**.

In Sylius they [removed 500 lines of unused code](https://github.com/Sylius/Sylius/pull/8557) just few days ago.

Among others it **removed dead constructor dependencies**.

It will not only make your code cleaner, but also can **speed up you container build** as a side effect.



## 4 Simple Checkers


```yaml
# easy-coding-standard.neon

checkers:
    # use short array []
    PhpCsFixer\Fixer\ArrayNotation\ArraySyntaxFixer:
        syntax: short

    # drop dead code
    - SlevomatCodingStandard\Sniffs\Classes\UnusedPrivateElementsSniff

    # drop dead use namespaces
    - PhpCsFixer\Fixer\Import\NoUnusedImportsFixer

    # and sort them A â†’ Z
    - PhpCsFixer\Fixer\Import\OrderedImportsFixer
```


## 4 Steps to Make Your Code Cleaner


1. Install it

    ```bash
    composer require --dev symplify/easy-coding-standard
    ```

2. Add checkers to `easy-coding-standard.neon` file


3. Check your code

    ```bash
    vendor/bin/ecs check src
    ```

4. Fix the code

    ```bash
    vendor/bin/ecs check src --fix
    ```


Happy coding!
