title: "4 Emotional and Honest Reasons I quit my Twitter"
perex: '''
    Nowadays we tend to live busy life with all those social networks, notifications and pings. So busy, we don't have emotional space to just evaluate "How do I like that?". In my life, this creates cycles, where I keep doing over and over the same thing without any progress. After few months feeling bad with Twitter, I've finally decided to quit. Rather from technical point of view, I will focus on my feelings. Because that's what matters most.

Before I started this article, I read 
[I Quit Twitter And My Life Got Better. Here's Why I'm Going Back](http://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenorsini/2015/11/11/i-quit-twitter-and-my-life-got-better-heres-why-im-going-back). In the article Lauren describes what was it like to have week of Twitter and why she got back. If you use Twitter, read it too. There are some great insights on autopilot. 

So, I felt bad using Twitter last few months. I wasn't sure if I really want to quit Twitter, so I tried small experiments: 

- I un-followed people down to zero.
- I limited my time there to end of the day. 
- I tried different approach Tweets and retweets.
- I talked with friend how do they enjoy Twitter.
- I tried pools to engage with followers in new way.
- I requested feedback from marketing expert to my Tweets.

I really tried, but nothing of this made me feel significantly better. So last experiment: I quit.

*Interesting. This is very similar to my approach to crisis in relationships.*

What were those deal breakers that tear us apart?


## 1. I was Addicted - Give me my Dopamine Shot!

Every like made me happy. Every retweet made happier three-times. I only wanted to invest just a little attention, so I refocused on numbers instead of content.
It's like trying to build a deep connection with somebody having a 20 minutes a days. This frustrated me a lot, because I prefer working on content over collecting numbers.

I talked about my addiction with [Petr Vácha](http://petrvacha.com/) and my intentions to quit, and he **suggested me to use it only once a day**.
I tried it for few days and it was great. I got higher dopamine shots in the end of the day.

The only issue for me was **I had to focus to not to focus on Twitter throughout the whole day**. It was like to starve the whole day to eat once in the evening.
It worked technically, **but it didn't feel right**. I could spend 5 minutes on 10 social networks and spend less then hour, but I want to enjoy this by heart, not by my inner computer. 

I know I can't do something for only 50 %. I either do it close to 100 % or go another way. 


## 2. I Tried so Hard to Look Good

- I planed Tweets for one per day, so I won't spam.
- I retweeted Tweets I found interesting.
- I've added images, hashtags. 
- I read many how-to-tweet articles.
- I tweeted only valuable and positive stuffs. Not in relation to reality, really. 

Few month later I realized **I'm turning into news machine**.

So I asked my followers, [how do you use Twitter](https://twitter.com/VotrubaT/status/816753682482085896)?

I found there are many news channel so field is already covered.

Second, I found I have reactive-response syndrome: for every message I have to have an answer. It's close to [fear of missing out](https://zenhabits.net/miss/). 

That included conversations under tweets, checking Twitter often for new answers, and trials to explain complex problems and miss-understandings under 140 characters. 


## 3. It's Boring

Twitter changed maybe once since I used it, not much news and social adaptions is slow - not many new people. 

I was trying to find fun in service that didn't gave it to me.
 
It's like finding passion in relations ship with woman I'm not attracted.


What I like about Facebook, Github or PHPStorm is that **they evolve and innovate**. Sometimes I like it, sometime not, but **I know they are trying to be better self**.
  
I Twitter would be person, it would be fearful virgin in his 30ties sticking to first job with no girlfriend.  

 

## 4. I already Love Somebody Else

140 limit for Tweet is fine, but I want to get deeper. I also don't like random Tweet stream: one day 50 tweets, other day 5. What the hell, man? That's so schizophrenic.

**I love system, regularity and predictability**. This the best way to educate constantly in certain speed.
 
That's why I switched from Tweetdeck-hashtag-group-following based to regular newsletter one in last year.

I started to follow: 

- [PHP Annotated Monthly](https://info.jetbrains.com/PHP-Annotated-Subscription.html) from JetBrains (PHPStorm guys)
- [PHP Weekly](http://www.phpweekly.com/)
- [Měsíčník pro Péhápkaře](pehapkari.cz/#newsletter)
- [Web Development Reading List](https://wdrl.info/) (thanks [Jakub Kratina](http://jakubkratina.cz/) for the tip 
- [The Open Circle](http://marketmeditations.com/theopencircle/)
- [Jan Růžička - Týden v Médiích](https://www.respekt.cz/echo/neco-konci-neco-zacina)
- [Eliška Vyhnánková](http://vyhnankova.cz/)

And it's much better.


## I Love Experiments

Leo Babauta happily dropped Twitter in 2013. In [Simplify the internet](Simplify the Internet) he wrotes

> If you’re going to do Facebook, don’t do other ones too. You can quit Twitter and Instagram. Really you can!

Reading this first time in December, I felt it's the right thing to do, yet brain opposing with "that insane!".

My great inspiration from polyphasic sleep days Steve Pavlina [got social media dumped hard](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2014/07/social-media-you-got-dumped/).

> I basically asked myself which scenario seemed best over the next 10 years — going social media-free vs. continuing to use it.

Followed by [a year later reflection](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2015/07/one-year-without-social-media/).

I love social experiments. After polyphasic sleep, switching main job focus after 8 years, having a baby while being infertile, dropping from university, moving to Prague after settling down in Brno, [droping LinkedIn](todo linkg) and moving completely alone for first time, I really look forward to this one.


## Where do I find you then?

As you can see I love newsletters. I'll be starting my soon and I'm still on Facebook.
Both you can find on my website [tomasvotruba.cz](https://www.tomasvotruba.cz/#socials).


## What about Your Socials Experiments?

I've already asked, why and what social networks do you use. 

Now, I would like to know, **have you made any social network experiment?**
How did it go? Did you liked that?

Look forward to your answers!
