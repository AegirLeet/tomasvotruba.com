        Right now I'm on "vacation" with my mom in Bulgaria, where temperatures are hot, but wind is strong, so it's not killing me. I write "vacation", because my definition of that term is work 6-8 hours a day just not at my home town :D.

    <h2>Rector Tour Finished + Rector CI in Progress</h2>

    <p>
        From May 10th till June 7th I visited 4 conferences in Europe - Verona, Moscow, Kyiv and Amsterdam. It was crazy month for me with 8 flights, but I've met many new and old friends, talked about work I love and got lot of positive and constructive feedback on Rector.
    </p>

    <p>
        We also started to work on <a href="http://rector-ci.org">Rector CI</a>, that will provide instant upgrades and refactoring at one click to anyone. We are now team of 2 with <a href="https://github.com/janmikes">Jan Mikes</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        We're putting together legal papers for future projects and Rector is now co-operating with 1st Prague company in size of ~20 people to get out of legacy.

    <h2>Czech PHP Community Website Updated</h2>

    <p>
        After over 12 months of coding, I've finally launched <a href="https://pehapkari.cz/vzdelavej-se/">new version of Pehapkari.cz trainings</a>. It runs on Symfony + EasyAdminBundle and is super smart. We've managed to find many bugs thanks to first 2 trainings we run on it. Also I've added page with <a href="https://pehapkari.cz/prehaj-si-prednasku/">all the videos</a> from meetups, conferences and livestream.
